# API

This document outlines the various exports and configuration options for the @brightlayer-ui/react-auth-shared package.

### SecurityContextProvider

SecurityContextProvider provides a single source of state for the state of user authentication. It is not meant to authenticate the user or hold credential information. Its purpose is to control access to authenticated or non-authenticated sections of the application (as well as change password for a currently authenticated user).

> Note: the `SecurityContextProvider` should come before the `AuthUIContextProvider` in your application hierarchy.

#### Usage

```tsx
import { SecurityContextProvider } from '@brightlayer-ui/react-native-auth-workflow';

<SecurityContextProvider>
    <AuthUIContextProvider {...props}>{/* ...contents */}</AuthUIContextProvider>
</SecurityContextProvider>;
```

A MockAuthUIActions implementation is provided in the examples folder for getting started with during development.

### Type Declaration

-   **changePassword**: _`(oldPassword: string, newPassword: string) => Promise<void>)`_

    -   An authenticated user wants to change their password. The application should try to change the user's password. Upon completion, the user will be logged out of the application. Upon cancellation, the user will be taken back to the application's home screen.
